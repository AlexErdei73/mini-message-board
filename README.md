# mini-message-board

This is a practice Express project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about)
just to practice the core Express features, like routes, middleware and views. The project is 
bootstrapped by the [express-generator](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).

The project shows you some hardcoded messages on the home page and you can add new messages if you
click on a button. The messages are not stored in a database, just in RAM, so there is no data retention.
More information can be found on the [mini-message-board](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-mini-message-board)
website.
